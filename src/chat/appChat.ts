/**
 * Talking to a deployed application's agent from VS Code (STUDIO A-18).
 *
 * The person signed in to Datalayer picks one of their deployments in the
 * Agent Chat sidebar and talks to it as its hosted page does: over the
 * runtime's session API, an AG-UI run on
 * `<runtime>/api/v1/apps/agents/<agent>/ag-ui/` whose thread is the session
 * (LOOP R-04, STUDIO R-02), on the runtime the deployment is kept on
 * (`kept.url`, `kept.agent_id`, R-33), with the person's own token. Its
 * approvals (R-05) are the Tool Approvals of ai-agents, answered in the
 * view; its tool calls are said as the transcript's lines (A-06); the
 * editor's open file is what VS Code passes as the host's `page` (D-10),
 * and only when the application's Appspec names it under
 * `deployment.embedded.host.context` and a rule lets `host_context` run.
 * An application that takes only a user
 * its host's server signed (D-21) is opened with a user token ai-agents
 * signs for the person signed in (`fetchUserToken`), sent with each run;
 * the deployed version's Appspec decides, never another's.
 *
 * Pure: no `vscode`, no React, no network. Imported by the extension host
 * (`AgentChatViewProvider`, which lists the deployments and lends the
 * person's token to the requests it may sign) and by the webview
 * (`webview/agentChat/AppChat.tsx`).
